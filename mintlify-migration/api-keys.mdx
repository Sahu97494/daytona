Daytona API keys are used to authenticate requests to the [Daytona API](/tools/api).

The [Configuration](/configuration) page covers how to set up your environment variables, including the `DAYTONA_API_KEY` environment variable.

To manage your API keys, go to the [Keys](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys) section in the Dashboard. Click `Create Key` to generate a new key and copy it to your clipboard.

{/* ## Expiration

When creating a new API Key you can optionally set an expiration date for the key. If no expiration date is set, the key will never expire. */}

## Permissions

When adding a new API Key you will be prompted to select a set of permissions for the key:

| Permission       | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Sandboxes`**  | Grants the ability to create and manage Sandboxes  |
| **`Snapshots`**  | Grants the ability to create and manage Snapshots  |
| **`Registries`** | Grants the ability to create and manage Registries |
| **`Volumes`**    | Grants the ability to create and manage Volumes    |

Each permission includes fine-grained scopes:

- `write:*` for creating and updating
- `delete:*` for deleting resources

Example: `write:sandboxes`, `delete:sandboxes`.
